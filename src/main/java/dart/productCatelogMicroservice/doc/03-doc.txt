    "name": "Parent Category 1",
    "description": "Description of Parent Category 1",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Parent Category 2",
    "description": "Description of Parent Category 2",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
Example Query
You would typically implement this endpoint by querying your categories table to find all categories where parent_id is NULL.

SQL Query Example
Here's a simple SQL query you might use to implement this endpoint:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE parent_id IS NULL AND is_active = TRUE;
This query will retrieve all active parent categories. Adjust the SQL and endpoint implementation as needed to fit your application's requirements.
